# Real-Time Sales Data Pipeline and Data Warehouse with PySpark

This project demonstrates a comprehensive real-time data warehouse solution for sales data from raw files.

## Project Overview

This project provides solutions for:

1. **Streaming Data Pipelines**: Efficiently processing and transforming incoming sales data in real-time.
2. **Data Warehouse**: Storing and managing the processed data for efficient querying and analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the stored data to derive meaningful insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Apache Spark (PySpark)**: Utilized for Structured Streaming to handle real-time data processing.
2. **SQL**: Employed for querying and managing data within the data warehouse.
3. **Python**: Along with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

This project showcases how to build an end-to-end real-time data warehouse solution, ensuring that sales data is processed, stored, and analyzed efficiently.
